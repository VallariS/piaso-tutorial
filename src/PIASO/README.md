# PIASO
### Precise Integrative Analysis of Single-cell Omics

### Current available functionalities
1. side-by-side cell embedding plots, e.g., split by Conditions
2. stacked violin plots for multiple features, including genes and cell metrics
3. perform dimensionality reduction by GDR
4. integration of scRNA-seq datasets by GDR
5. integration of scRNA-seq data and MERFISH data by GDR
6. run clustering on selected cluster(s)

### Coming functionalities
1. preprocessing of scATAC-seq datasets
2. integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets (not replying on gene activities)
3. and others
